# MSFS2020-SDK-expert-for-new-project

Our client has a project of MSFS2020 so we are looking for MSFS2020 SDK developer, 3D artist(start next Monday).

Our client has one project of MSFS2020 and we are looking for MSFS2020 experienced developer
#### MSFS2020 SDK ####
Our final purpose is to import your custom airplane 3D model you created from scratch into MSFS 2020 and make the instruments functional.

- The airplane needs to have the proper animations, properties, etc to function in the game.

For this, we need a talented MSFS2020 SDK experienced developer.

So, it's just a brand new airplane that needs to work in MSFS2020.

We have no experience with MSFS2020 SDK so we don't know about following stuffs
* What does it take to make the altimeter, airspeed indicator, etc work?
* What about the airplane physics?
  The max speed, engine performance, wing extension, etc?
Maybe you should know about this physics, etc.
So, we are in need of professional who can guide us how to proceed, too.


If you think you can handle, we can discuss further
